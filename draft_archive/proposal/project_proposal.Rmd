# Business Senario (What)

Act as a data scientist in the beauty product company, apply NLP and unsupervised learning technique to mine online customer's product reviews and customer data, deliver business insights to the relevant stakeholders.

-   Two main business objectives:

    1.  **Product-centric**: Based on customer product reviews, cluster the reviews to discover the strengths and weaknesses of products that are in the same cluster, and analyze clusters by using available features to deliver insights to the product and marketing teams.

    2.  **Customer-centric**: Create a customer dataframe (customer as the primary key) containing aggregated features such as avg_rating, total_reviews and preferred_category. Perform clustering on the customers to identify customer segments.

    Analyze both clustering results, expecting the existence of cluster intersections, for example, one cluster of customers corresponds to one cluster of product reviews, which can be leveraged to design targeted customer actions.

# Project Purpose (Why)

-   Connecting the machine learning model results with business needs is crucial for data science practitioners in the industry. This project, which simulates a business scenario using machine learning techniques on a realistic Sephora dataset, provides a great chance for me to practice this ability.

-   This proposed project is closely related to data science work in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, which is my intended career path. It provides an opportunity to develop a comprehensive project that can be included in my data science portfolio.

# Dataset

-   [**Sephora Products and Skincare Reviews**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews/data)

    Primary key: product_id, review_id

    Foreign key: product_id

    -   Two tables:

        -   product information (8494 products in total): product name, price ...

        -   customer information (1,094,411 reviews in total, dates ranging from 2018 to 2023, may not use all the data): reviews, customer profile ...
